				When racial or religious lines are drawn by the State
			</a>
		</h3>
		
		<blockquote>
			<p>When racial or religious lines are drawn by the State, the multi-racial, multi-religious communities that our Constitution seeks to weld together as one become separatist; antagonisms that relate to race or to religion, rather than to political issues, are generated; communities seek not the best representative, but the best racial or religious partisan. </p>

				Very large social units are imaginary
			</a>
		</h3>
		
		<blockquote>
			<p>Very large social units are always, in a sense, imaginary. Or, to put it in a slightly different way, there is always a fundamental distinction between the way one relates to friends, family, neighbourhood, people and places that we actually know directly, and the way one relates to empires, nations and metropolises, phenomena that exist largely, or at least most of the time, in our heads. </p>

				Many humans just don't like their families
			</a>
		</h3>
		
		<blockquote>
			<p>There is an obvious objection to evolutionary models which assume that our strongest social ties are based on close biological kinship: many humans just don&#8217;t like their families very much. And this appears to be just as true of present-day hunter-gatherers as anybody else. Many seem to find the prospect of living their entire lives surrounded by close relatives so unpleasant that they will travel very long distances just to get away from them. </p>

		</h3>
		
		<blockquote>
			<p>I grow little of the food I eat, and of the little I do grow I did not breed or perfect the seeds.  </p>

<p>I do not make any of my own clothing.  </p>

<p>I speak a language I did not invent or refine.  </p>

<p>I did not discover the mathematics I use.  </p>

<p>I am protected by freedoms and laws I did not conceive of or legislate, and do not enforce or adjudicate.  </p>

<p>I am moved by music I did not create myself.  </p>

<p>When I needed medical attention, I was helpless to help myself survive.  </p>

<p>I did not invent the transistor, the microprocessor, object oriented programming, or most of the technology I work with.  </p>

<p>I love and admire my species, living and dead, and am totally dependent on them for my life and well being. </p>

		</h3>
		
		<blockquote>
			<p>Our conventional response to all media, namely that it is how they are used that counts, is the numb stance of the technological idiot. For the ‘content’ of a medium is like the juicy piece of meat carried by the burglar to distract the watchdog of the mind. </p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>That’s how my brain felt to me, too. Hungry. Needy. Itchy. Once it wanted information. But then it was distraction. And then, with social media, validation. A drumbeat of: You exist. You are seen. </p>
