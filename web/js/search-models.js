		content: "A number of authors and systems of thought espouse one or another series of developmental levels in fields of study as diverse as psychology sociology economics and organizational development Ken Wilber wilber was the first author I encountered who proposed an integration of these various developmental progressions into a single unifying scheme However much of Ken s take on these levels was heavily influenced by the Spiral Dynamics spiral work done by Clare W Graves graves Don Beck beck and Chris Cowan And Hanzi Freinacht provides yet another take on this stuff in his book The Listening Society https www amazon com Listening Society Metamodern Politics Guides dp 8799973901 So what do we mean by a level of development in this context Here s where it gets a little tricky Both in terms of individual development and in terms of sociocultural development these levels seem to emerge in a certain sequence However later levels do not supersede or invalidate earlier levels Rather than replacing previous levels each emergent level expands the complexity and capacity of individuals and societies And so Wilber and Beck and Cowan have tried to use colors to identify the levels rather than numbers in order to avoid giving the impression that later levels are somehow superior to earlier levels At some point along the line though Ken Wilber and the Integral crew decided it was important to change some of the colors I ve listed both the original Spiral Dynamics colors and the newer Integral colors in the table below but in general I will stick with the original colors from Beck and Cowan Also there has been a later tendency to add new higher levels to the upper end of this range I ve not been able to make much sense of these myself so I m omitting them here As we go through these levels we can make use of The Four Quadrants model to see that each level has a particular subjective or intersubjective viewpoint as well as typical social structures that can be identified from an interobjective perspective There s a certain chicken and the egg sort of dilemma we face when trying to disentangle the objective social aspects of a level from its subjective aspects but for me it feels more natural to consider the objective social aspects first so I ll proceed in that manner Also it s worth noting that as we proceed through the levels they tend to alternate between an assertion of individual power archaic tribal modern integral and then a more community based perspective magical traditional postmodern holistic Here s a table listing all of

>Turquoise < td> < tr> < table> Following are more detailed descriptions of each level Beige Instinctual This is really a pre social level prior to the introduction of any sort of society at all At this level humans + are focused solely on immediate survival needs + have a minimal sense of self + exhibit behavior based on natural instincts and reflexes + are concerned only for the physical self and physical environment + possess nothing that we would recognize as society or culture We may think of this first level as hopelessly primitive but it s important to include it because all of us are still motivated by basic survival instincts fight or flight hunger thirst lust avoidance of pain and physical danger and so on Some social structures can override these basic instincts as when a soldier goes to war to protect his or her country but these basic survival motivations are all still present and so must be kept in mind and accounted for It s important to note though that a human being motivated only by these basic instincts is generally categorized as a sociopath and for good reason So while this level is a necessary starting point nothing here offers table stakes to get you into the game called humanity Purple Magical At this second level social structures begin to emerge dominated primarily by kin relationships The family structure serves to conserve knowledge and property by sharing these assets among family members and passing them down from one generation to the next Language starts to come into play at this level but still limited to oral forms At this level of development humans + are beginning to differentiate self from world + are beginning to differentiate elements of the world from one another + can intuit causal relationships but with no reliable understanding of how these work + tend to act on impulse + pass down ancestral stories + possess faith in magic and superheroes + have superstitious beliefs And while from the lofty vantage point of later levels this magical level may still seem terribly primitive it is vital to recognize that all of us still possess this way of seeing the world and exercise it on a regular basis Red Tribal The primary form of social organization at this level is the power pyramid a hierarchical command and control structure in which those above have power over those below and in which the strongest rise towards the apex of the pyramid Written language starts to come into play at this level as multi level hierarchies begin to issue written commands At this level of development humans + tend to be egocentric + assert themselves for dominance conquest and power + have strong feelings of loyalty to their tribes and their tribal leaders + believe that might makes right This level of development is the dominant one in feudal empires criminal gangs and military organizations But the power hierarchy is also a dominant structure in most corporations in the executive branches of governments as well as in some organized religions Blue Traditional At this level people organize themselves around written rules and traditions handed down from a higher authority groups organized in this way require strict adherence to the group s rules for members of such a group the validity of the higher authority and the rules are fundamental and not to be questioned This level of development is often dominant in religious fundamentalism and in societies with strict codes of ethics including both professional and patriotic groups This level offers increased flexibility over the tribal level in that written rules of conduct can be applied universally and are not dependent on access to the latest commands issued by the higher levels in a hierarchy Orange Modern At this level of development people use experimentation and peer networks to establish reliable statements of truth This level emphasizes the importance of what actually works over what is commonly accepted to be true Science and engineering propelled by quantitative methods emerge as dominant disciplines at this level This level often emphasizes the importance of new scientific discoveries and applications of technology over the dictates of traditional wisdom Green Postmodern This social structure brings together people with many different interests skills and backgrounds into a shared community in which all have equal status Diversity is actively valued as a means of improving social cohesion and as a means of bringing to bear as many different talents and points of view as possible In this structure individuals are encouraged to explore and discover new and meaningful ways of connecting with one another essentially creating emergent structure The World Wide Web is based on this organizational system At this level of development humans + have a heightened sensitivity to inequities + attempt to reach consensus rather than seeking decisions from anointed leaders + have high empathy skills + often value emotions above cognitive reasoning + adopt an attitude of relativism towards values and statements of truth rather than a belief in absolute truth Yellow Integral The Integral level of development recognizes that each preceding level addresses some aspect of reality that is necessary for human development and in fact that any one of the preceding levels may need to be activated in certain life conditions Unlike each of the earlier levels that tend to experience the world only through their blinkered perspective the integral level includes and transcends prior levels and humans operating at this level tend to have flexible dynamic adaptive attitudes towards the social groups in which they participate Humans operating at this level tend to see existing social structures as systems that can be changed rather than inflexible constructs and may see themselves as change agents for systems rather than players limited to operating within existing systems Turquoise Holistic At this level of development humans have a more flexible adaptive and inclusive feelings about the continuing evolution of the cosmos"

		content: "I originally came across this model in a book by Ken Wilber titled A Brief History of Everything It s become a foundational piece of Wilber s Integral Philosophy something he terms AQAL for All Quadrants All Levels But I ve found over the years that the Four Quadrants model can stand on its own and be usefully understood and applied without reference to other pieces of Wilber s philosopy I m going to describe my understanding of this model as it applies to us humans Wilber often describes it in more general broadly philosophical terms In Brief We tend to perceive reality from four different perspectives ofter referred as the four quadrants Understanding these perspectives as four valid and complementary ways of perceiving the world helps us gain a more complete and useful understanding of people and situations An understanding of these four quadrants of perception is useful because it helps us understand that very different views of reality Freudian psychology vs Skinner s behaviorism for example are not contradictory or mutually exclusive but rather are complementary Views from these different perspectives may be equally valid even if they are very different ways of looking at the world The four quadrants are formed by the intersection of two dimensions The first dimension left or right can be expressed as either interior or exterior The second dimension up or down can be expressed as either individual or collective Combining these we get the four quadrants We can think of these as the individual subjective the individual objective the social objective and the social subjective Individual Subjective Each of us experiences a complex inner world of sensations emotions thoughts and feelings And while others may report having similar feelings or very different ones no one else can actually experience our inner world in the same way that we can These inner experiences can vary from the mundane hunger pain fear to the sublime wonder love reverence The inner experiences that we have can be highly individual you and I may have very different inner reactions to something happening in the world around us And the relationships between external stimuli and our inner feelings can sometimes be obvious but at other times rather complex and even mysterious When considering the multiple perspectives we can take regarding a thing some of these viewpoints may fairly be considered subjective This is not to imply that subjective views are invalid or unworthy of consideration far from it The Individual Subjective is depicted in the upper left quadrant of the diagram and so is sometimes referred to simply as UL Individual Objective An objective perspective views something from an outer or exterior vantage point and does so without being unduly influenced by the personal feelings or opinions of the observers Unlike subjective perspectives other objective observers should be able to put themselves in our shoes and make the same observations that we have from the same perspective One of the advantages of an objective perspective is that multiple independent observers should be able to agree on the characteristics or attributes of an object being observed and can therefore reach agreement on what we generally describe as the facts of the matter The Individual Objective is depicted in the upper right quadrant of the diagram and so is sometimes referred to simply as UR Social Subjective Humans also have subjective experiences of the societies that we form and the groups in which we participate Because these experiences are generally shared we can refer to this sort of perspective as an intersubjective one Each one of us is a member of one or more groups We may be part of a family part of a team part of an organization part of a state And such groups tend to have their own special perspectives and their own sets of interests And members of such groups tend to share certain attributes of their interior worlds such as a common set of values Elements of our cultures shared symbols and stories and other artifacts help to bind us together into closely knit societies by encouraging and shaping common inner thoughts and feelings about the forms of our societies and the ways in which we work together The Social Subjective is depicted in the lower left quadrant of the diagram and so is sometimes referred to simply as LL Social Objective This is an objective view not of a single individual but of a collective or what we might call a society including observations of social systems as members of the society interact with each other This is the perspective we take when viewing a human society from the exterior This might include observation of their rituals their institutions their means of communication and means of value exchange This is sometimes called an interobjective perspective The Social Objective is depicted in the lower right quadrant of the diagram and so is sometimes referred to simply as LR Harari s Distinctions It s worth noting that Yuval Noah Harari in his book Sapiens A Brief History of Humankind uses the terms subjective intersubjective and objective to describe respectively the upper left lower left and right hand sides of the four quadrants defining them like this An objective right hand phenomenon exists independently of human consciousness and human beliefs The subjective upper left is something that exists depending on the consciousness and beliefs of a single individual It disappears or changes if that particular individual changes his or her beliefs The intersubjective lower left is something that exists within the communication network linking the subjective consciousness of many individuals If a single individual changes his or her beliefs or even dies it is of little importance However if most individuals in the network die or change their beliefs the inter subjective phenomenon will mutate or disappear Example of Application from Rob Austin The Four Quadrants model can be applied in all sorts of contexts which is part of what makes it so useful Let me give you a couple of business examples Take a look at the following words from Rob Austin austin in his insightful little book <cite> Measuring and Managing Performance in Organizations austin1 < cite> > One frequent analogy casts the manager in the role of an airplane pilot guided by organizational measures that are like cockpit instruments > > Mechanistic and organic analogies are flawed because they are too simplistic Kaplan and Norton s cockpit analogy would be more accurate if it included a multitude of tiny gremlins controlling wing flaps fuel flow and so on of a plane being buffeted by winds and generally struggling against nature but with the gremlins always controlling information flow back to the cockpit instruments for fear that the pilot might find gremlin replacements It would not be surprising if airplanes guided this way occasionally flew into mountainsides when they seemed to be progressing smoothly toward their destinations Note that Rob starts with exterior perspectives of collectives a manager guiding an organization and a pilot flying an aircraft But then he goes on to expose the interior feeling fear of individuals who are not only being guided but being asked to objectively report the data on which their performance will be graded He then suggests the sort of culture interior such a collective of gremlins might develop in such conditions and what sort of collective behavior they might exhibit So while Austin may not have consciously or explicitly referred to the Four Quadrants model seeing his work as an example of this model may help us gain similarly powerful insights in other situations Example of Application from Liker Hoseus Here is another example from <cite> Toyota Culture The Heart and Soul of The Toyota Way toyota culture < cite> by Jeffrey Liker and Mike Hoseus Here Mike tells a story of learning first hand some of the elements of the Toyota culture > As a new group leader I was sent to Tsutsumi to spend a month getting an appreciation of working on the line and mastering one process The team leaders told us no one would be able to complete the whole job by the end of the month but I was determined to prove them wrong I was installing liners underneath the wheel well when my air gun slipped and the driver bit scratched the paint on the inner lip of the wheel well I gasped and looked around no one saw me do it but they had told me to pull the andon rope cord if I made or caught any defect It was my moment of truth My first reaction was to let it go No one would probably see the scratch anyway and no one would know that I made it But my conscience got the best of me and I wanted to see if they really meant what they said about admitting mistakes So I pulled the andon and the team leader came to fix the problem and showed me how to hold the bit with a free finger in order to stabilize it better But he did not seem angry at me for making the scratch > > Then at break we gathered for our afternoon group meeting where the group leader gave out information on safety and quality issues and heard back concerns from the members > > They spoke Japanese so I could not understand what they were saying until I heard the words Mike san Well that got my attention so I listened carefully more Japanese and then scratchee scratchee and then more Japanese So here it was finally I was going to get called out for messing up and they were going to do it in front of everyone Then all of a sudden the whole group looked at me and clapped and smiled and patted my back and shook my hand as they headed back to the line I couldn t believe it after double checking with an interpreter just to make sure they were applauding me because I made a mistake and admitted it I felt like a million bucks and guess what I did the next time I made a mistake Notice how the story talks about individual behavior Exterior of an Individual group behavior Exterior of a Collective individual feelings Interior of an Individual and group culture Interior of a Collective And while these are four distinct perspectives they are all describing the same set of events Note also that while these are distinctly different perspectives they are not unrelated quite the opposite in fact Mike s story clearly shows how an individual and then a group responded to an event how the culture was evidenced by the group s behavior and then how that behavior made an individual feel which influenced his future feelings and behavior This is the beauty of the Four Quadrants model in that it gives us a complete picture of reality and increases our understanding of that reality Many lean transformation efforts fail for example because they are focused only on productivity improvements Exterior of a Collective and fail to instill the corresponding cultural elements necessary to support the desired behavior austin http www cbs dk en research departments and centres department of management politics and philosophy staff rampp
