					Capitalists who worship only at the feet of capitalism

			</h3>
			
			<blockquote>
				<p>Democratic capitalism is a wonderful device precisely because it maximizes the ability of individuals within society to singly and collectively pursue the ends that <em>they</em> find to be important and meaningful; the accomplishments of a capitalistic society are noble and grand to the extent that the ends pursued by its individuals aspire to these lofty goals, and bereft to the extent that the intentions of its citizens are mean and unworthy; nothing makes capitalism appear more hollow than capitalists who worship only at the feet of capitalism: they are like workmen who have fallen in love with their tools, while blind to the glories of the cathedrals these tools have built and can yet build. </p>

				<p>The increase of wealth is not boundless. A stationary condition of capital and population implies no stationary state of human improvement. There would be as much scope as ever for all kinds of mental culture, and moral and social progress; as much room for improving the art of living, and much more likelihood of it being improved, when minds ceased to be engrossed by the art of getting on. </p>

					Invest in your employees 
				</a>
			</h3>
			
			<blockquote>
				<p>I give them [other business owners] the same advice my grandfather had when he was starting the business [Dick&#8217;s Drive-Ins]. A business, first step, is it has to make a profit. The next step is to invest in your employees. They&#8217;ll take better care of your customers, which will help you earn more profit. When they move on from your business and do other things, they&#8217;re evangelists for your company and that helps you make more profit. Once that virtuous cycle is going, you can also invest in your community because if your community is thriving, your business will thrive. And so for these businesses that come to us asking what they should do first, the biggest thing I tell them is to talk to your employees. Ask them what it is that your employee population would want. Talk to them! Start with that. And if you can&#8217;t do it for everybody or everything that they would want, just do some part of it, then work your way up from there. </p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>Liberalism is not Socialism, and never will be. There is a great gulf fixed. It is not a gulf of method, it is a gulf of principle. … Socialism seeks to pull down wealth. Liberalism seeks to raise up poverty. Socialism would destroy private interests; Liberalism would preserve private interests in the only way in which they can be safely and justly preserved, namely by reconciling them with public right. Socialism would kill enterprise; Liberalism would rescue enterprise from the trammels of privilege and preference … Socialism exalts the rule; Liberalism exalts the man. Socialism attacks capital; Liberalism attacks monopoly. </p>

				<p>Human development research offers a different formula: All of life is a series of daring adventures from a secure base. If government can create a framework in which people grow up amid healthy families, nurturing schools, thick communities and a secure safety net, then they will have the resources and audacity to thrive in a free global economy and a diversifying skills economy. </p>

				<p>The word &#8216;economics&#8217; was coined by the philosopher Xenophon in Ancient Greece. Combining <em>oikos</em> meaning household with <em>nomos</em> meaning rules or norms, he invented the art of household management, and it could not be more relevant today. This century we need some pretty insightful managers to guide our planetary household, and ones who are ready to pay attention to the needs of all of its inhabitants. </p>

				<p>Stakeholder capitalism is not about politics. It is not a social or ideological agenda.

This is the power of capitalism. </p>

					A Progressive Annual Tax on Capital 
				</a>
			</h3>
			
			<blockquote>
				<p>The right solution is a progressive annual tax on capital. This will make it possible to avoid an endless inegalitarian spiral while preserving competition and incentives for new instances of primitive accumulation&#8230;. This would contain the unlimited growth of global inequality of wealth, which is currently increasing at a rate that cannot be sustained in the long run and that ought to worry even the most fervent champions of the self-regulated market. Historical experience shows, moreover, that such immense inequalities of wealth have little to do with the entrepreneurial spirit and are of no use in promoting growth. Nor are they of any &#8216;common utility,&#8217; to borrow the nice expression from the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen with which I began this book. </p>

				<p>On the face of it, shareholder value is the dumbest idea in the world. Shareholder value is a result, not a strategy&#8230; your main constituencies are your employees, your customers and your products.

				<p>We are being afflicted with a new disease of which some readers may not yet have heard the name, but of which they will hear a great deal in the years to come &#8211; namely, technological unemployment.

			<blockquote>
				<p>Capitalism has the power to shape society and act as a powerful catalyst for change. But businesses can’t do this alone, and they cannot be the climate police. That will not be a good outcome for society. We need governments to provide clear pathways and a consistent taxonomy for sustainability policy, regulation, and disclosure across markets. When we harness the power of both the public and private sectors, we can achieve truly incredible things. This is what we must do to get to net zero. </p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>Workers demanding more from their employers is an essential feature of effective capitalism. It drives prosperity and creates a more competitive landscape for talent, pushing companies to create better, more innovative environments for their employees – actions that will help them achieve greater profits for their shareholders. Companies that deliver are reaping the rewards. </p>

					A Work Ethic Gone Mad 
				</a>
			</h3>
			
			<blockquote>
				<p>The blend of corporate mysticism and transcendental consumerism he [Tom Peters] offers has its roots planted in the pragmatic, optimistic, can-do American work ethic. But, like the Taylorist philosophy from which it springs, it is also a work ethic gone mad. It begins with the idea that work can be meaningful and stretches it to the point where there is no meaning outside work. It becomes a deluded form of optimism, a feverish activity that masks an underlying anxiety about the meaning of life, a form of self-alienation so complete that the self disappears entirely into its consumer preferences and transactions. </p>

					The yen to work drops in flat economies 
				</a>
			</h3>
			
			<blockquote>
				<p>Writing in the 1950s, Daniel Bell, the great American sociologist, said &#8216;economic growth has become the secular religion of advancing industrial societies&#8217;. He was right. It follows that in its absence, many people lapse into the equivalent of atheism. That sense of listlessness shows up in many ways. In the labour market, it means falling rates of workforce participation. Much as the desire to worship falls in agnostic societies, the yen to work drops in flat economies. In the last decade, America&#8217;s share of people in full-time jobs has dropped to European levels, which used to be written off as a sclerotic consequence of the continent&#8217;s over-regulated labour markets. Now the US rate is bang on the European average. In some respects it is worse. There is now a higher share of French males in full-time jobs than Americans &#8211; a statistic that reflects poorly on America, rather than well on France. </p>
