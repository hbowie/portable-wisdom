			<h3>
				<a href="../quotes/i-must-study-politics-and-war.html">
					I must study politics and war 
				</a>
			</h3>
			
			<blockquote>
				<p>I must study politics and war, that our sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy. Our sons ought to study mathematics and philosophy, geography, natural history and naval architecture, navigation, commerce and agriculture in order to give their children a right to study painting, poetry, music, architecture, statuary, tapestry and porcelain. </p>

			<h3>
				<a href="../quotes/the-institution-of-the-family.html">
					The institution of the family 
				</a>
			</h3>
			
			<blockquote>
				<p>The institution of the family is decisive in determining not only if a person has the capacity to love another individual but in the larger social sense whether he is capable of loving his fellow men collectively. The whole of society rests on this foundation for stability, understanding and social peace. </p>

				<a href="../quotes/life-is-a-series-of-daring-adventures-from-a-secure-base.html">
					Life is a series of daring adventures from a secure base 
				</a>
			</h3>
			
			<blockquote>
				<p>Human development research offers a different formula: All of life is a series of daring adventures from a secure base. If government can create a framework in which people grow up amid healthy families, nurturing schools, thick communities and a secure safety net, then they will have the resources and audacity to thrive in a free global economy and a diversifying skills economy. </p>

				<a href="../quotes/quality-of-children-vs-quantity.html">
					Quality of Children vs. Quantity 
				</a>
			</h3>
			
			<blockquote>
				<p>Instead of needing lots of children, we need high-quality children. </p>

				<a href="../quotes/that-community-asks-for-and-gets-chaos.html">
					That community asks for and gets chaos 
				</a>
			</h3>
			
			<blockquote>
				<p>From the wild Irish slums of the 19th century Eastern seaboard, to the riot-torn suburbs of Los Angeles, there is one unmistakable lesson in American history; a community that allows a large number of men to grow up in broken families, dominated by women, never acquiring any stable relationship to male authority, never acquiring any set of rational expectations about the future &#8211; that community asks for and gets chaos. Crime, violence, unrest, disorder &#8211; most particularly the furious, unrestrained lashing out at the whole social structure &#8211; that is not only to be expected; it is very near to inevitable. And it is richly deserved. </p>

			<h3>
				<a href="../quotes/you-can-simply-focus-on-raising-a-human-being.html">
					You can simply focus on raising a human being 
				</a>
			</h3>
			
			<blockquote>
				<p>Imagine, then, what it&#8217;s like to be a Nordic parent. You can simply focus on raising a human being, in an age-appropriate way at every stage, without ever once feeling guilty that you&#8217;re not saving enough money, or not making enough money, to secure them the college education they&#8217;ll need to avoid ending up in the gutter. </p>
