				<p>In all cultures, ceremonies are designed to communicate the experience of one group of people to the wider community. When people bury loved ones, when they wed, when they graduate from college, the respective ceremonies communicate something essential to the people who are watching. </p>

					I love and admire my species

			</h3>
			
			<blockquote>
				<p>I grow little of the food I eat, and of the little I do grow I did not breed or perfect the seeds.  </p>

<p>I do not make any of my own clothing.  </p>

<p>I speak a language I did not invent or refine.  </p>

<p>I did not discover the mathematics I use.  </p>

<p>I am protected by freedoms and laws I did not conceive of or legislate, and do not enforce or adjudicate.  </p>

<p>I am moved by music I did not create myself.  </p>

<p>When I needed medical attention, I was helpless to help myself survive.  </p>

<p>I did not invent the transistor, the microprocessor, object oriented programming, or most of the technology I work with.  </p>

<p>I love and admire my species, living and dead, and am totally dependent on them for my life and well being. </p>

					Immigration is tough, and it always has been 
				</a>
			</h3>
			
			<blockquote>
				<p>Immigration is tough. It always has been because, on the one hand, I think we are naturally a people that wants to help others. And we see tragedy and hardship and families that are desperately trying to get here so that their kids are safe, and they&#8217;re in some cases fleeing violence or catastrophe. At the same time, we&#8217;re a nation state. We have borders. The idea that we can just have open borders is something that &#8230; as a practical matter, is unsustainable. </p>

					Learn why the world wags and what wags it 
				</a>
			</h3>
			
			<blockquote>
				<p>You may grow old and trembling in your anatomies, you may lie awake at night listening to the disorders of your veins, you may miss your only love, you may see the world about you devastated by evil lunatics, or know your honour trampled in the sewers of baser minds. There is only one thing for it then &#8211; to learn. Learn why the world wags and what wags it. That is the only thing which the mind can never exhaust, never alienate, never be tortured by, never fear or distrust, and never dream of regretting. </p>

				<a href="../quotes/societies-are-not-merely-statistical-aggregations.html">
					Societies are not merely statistical aggregations 
				</a>
			</h3>
			
			<blockquote>
				<p>Societies are not merely statistical aggregations of individuals engaged in voluntary exchange but something much more subtle and complicated. A group or community cannot be understood if the unit of analysis is the individual taken by himself. A society is clearly something greater than the sum of its parts. </p>

				<a href="../quotes/the-system-vs-goals-model.html">
					The system-vs-goals model 
				</a>
			</h3>
			
			<blockquote>
				<p>If you do something every day, it’s a system. If you’re waiting to achieve it someday in the future, it’s a goal. </p>

<p>… </p>

<p>[O]ne should have a system instead of a goal. The system-versus-goals model can be applied to most human endeavours. In the world of dieting, losing twenty pounds is a goal, but eating right is a system. In the exercise realm, running a marathon in under four hours is a goal, but exercising daily is a system. In business, making a million dollars is a goal, but being a serial entrepreneur is a system. </p>

<p>… </p>

<p>Goal-oriented people exist in a state of continuous pre-success failure at best, and permanent failure at worst if things never work out. Systems people succeed every time they apply their systems, in the sense that they did what they intended to do. The goals people are fighting the feeling of discouragement at each turn. The systems people are feeling good every time they apply their system. That’s a big difference in terms of maintaining your personal energy in the right direction. </p>

					To build a new and vital commons sector

			<blockquote>
				<p>The great task of the twenty-first century is to build a new and vital commons sector that can resist enclosure and externalization by the market, protect the planet, and share the fruits of our common inheritances more equitably than is now the case. </p>

					Very large social units are imaginary 
				</a>
			</h3>
			
			<blockquote>
				<p>Very large social units are always, in a sense, imaginary. Or, to put it in a slightly different way, there is always a fundamental distinction between the way one relates to friends, family, neighbourhood, people and places that we actually know directly, and the way one relates to empires, nations and metropolises, phenomena that exist largely, or at least most of the time, in our heads. </p>

				<p>It’s never been more essential for CEOs to have a consistent voice, a clear purpose, a coherent strategy, and a long-term view. Your company’s purpose is its north star in this tumultuous environment. Putting your company’s purpose at the foundation of your relationships with your stakeholders is critical to long-term success. </p>
