		<blockquote>
			<p>Immigration is tough. It always has been because, on the one hand, I think we are naturally a people that wants to help others. And we see tragedy and hardship and families that are desperately trying to get here so that their kids are safe, and they&#8217;re in some cases fleeing violence or catastrophe. At the same time, we&#8217;re a nation state. We have borders. The idea that we can just have open borders is something that &#8230; as a practical matter, is unsustainable. </p>
