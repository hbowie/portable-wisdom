		<h1>Technology married with the humanities</h1>

		<p>topics: integral</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>Technology alone is not enough. It&#8217;s technology married with the liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields the results that makes our hearts sing. </p>

<p>Nowhere is that more true than in these post-PC devicesâ€¦ that need to be even easier to use than a PC, that need to be even more intuitive than a PC; and where the software and the hardware and the applications need to intertwine in an even more seamless way than they do on a PC. </p>

<p>We think we are on the right track with this. We think we have the right architecture not just in silicon but in the organization to build these kinds of products. </p>
