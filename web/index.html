<h2 id="intro-to-the-site">Intro to the Site</h2>

<p>Let&#8217;s start with some definitions. </p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Portable</em>: small and light enough to be easily transferred from one place to another, with the ability to be used and reused in a variety of contexts; </p></li>
<li><p><em>Wisdom</em>: a body of knowledge and principles distilled from experience, and forming the basis for sound judgment and action. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>The goal of this site is to offer a collection of concise bits of text that quickly convey ideas of great value, often delivered in a memorable fashion. </p>

<p>The site is divided up into three sections. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Lists &#8211; These are simple, straightforward lists of important items that form some sort of whole greater than just the sum of the parts. </p></li>
<li><p>Models &#8211; These often consist of lists as well, but accompanied by diagrams that spell out more complex relationships between the items. </p></li>
<li><p>Quotes &#8211; These are direct quotations, each generally expressing one notable idea. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Below you will find the latest additions to the site, although I encourage you to  browse around as your interests take you. </p>

				Elements of an Improvement Process

<p>There is general scientific consenus these days that all forms of life on Earth have developed through the slow process of evolution, using the development engine of natural selection. </p>

				Very large social units are imaginary
			</a>
		</h3>
		
		<blockquote>
			<p>Very large social units are always, in a sense, imaginary. Or, to put it in a slightly different way, there is always a fundamental distinction between the way one relates to friends, family, neighbourhood, people and places that we actually know directly, and the way one relates to empires, nations and metropolises, phenomena that exist largely, or at least most of the time, in our heads. </p>

				Many humans just don't like their families
			</a>
		</h3>
		
		<blockquote>
			<p>There is an obvious objection to evolutionary models which assume that our strongest social ties are based on close biological kinship: many humans just don&#8217;t like their families very much. And this appears to be just as true of present-day hunter-gatherers as anybody else. Many seem to find the prospect of living their entire lives surrounded by close relatives so unpleasant that they will travel very long distances just to get away from them. </p>

				I love and admire my species
			</a>
		</h3>
		
		<blockquote>
			<p>I grow little of the food I eat, and of the little I do grow I did not breed or perfect the seeds.  </p>

<p>I do not make any of my own clothing.  </p>

<p>I speak a language I did not invent or refine.  </p>

<p>I did not discover the mathematics I use.  </p>

<p>I am protected by freedoms and laws I did not conceive of or legislate, and do not enforce or adjudicate.  </p>

<p>I am moved by music I did not create myself.  </p>

<p>When I needed medical attention, I was helpless to help myself survive.  </p>

<p>I did not invent the transistor, the microprocessor, object oriented programming, or most of the technology I work with.  </p>

<p>I love and admire my species, living and dead, and am totally dependent on them for my life and well being. </p>

			</a>
		</h3>
		
		<blockquote>
			<p>Our conventional response to all media, namely that it is how they are used that counts, is the numb stance of the technological idiot. For the ‘content’ of a medium is like the juicy piece of meat carried by the burglar to distract the watchdog of the mind. </p>

				My brain felt hungry
			</a>
		</h3>
		
		<blockquote>
			<p>That’s how my brain felt to me, too. Hungry. Needy. Itchy. Once it wanted information. But then it was distraction. And then, with social media, validation. A drumbeat of: You exist. You are seen. </p>

		<h3>
			<a href="quotes/the-system-vs-goals-model.html">
				The system-vs-goals model
			</a>
		</h3>
		
		<blockquote>
			<p>If you do something every day, it’s a system. If you’re waiting to achieve it someday in the future, it’s a goal. </p>

<p>… </p>

<p>[O]ne should have a system instead of a goal. The system-versus-goals model can be applied to most human endeavours. In the world of dieting, losing twenty pounds is a goal, but eating right is a system. In the exercise realm, running a marathon in under four hours is a goal, but exercising daily is a system. In business, making a million dollars is a goal, but being a serial entrepreneur is a system. </p>

<p>… </p>

<p>Goal-oriented people exist in a state of continuous pre-success failure at best, and permanent failure at worst if things never work out. Systems people succeed every time they apply their systems, in the sense that they did what they intended to do. The goals people are fighting the feeling of discouragement at each turn. The systems people are feeling good every time they apply their system. That’s a big difference in terms of maintaining your personal energy in the right direction. </p>

				Continually debating people and never winning
			</a>
		</h3>
		
		<blockquote>
			<p>If your view of the world is that people use reason for their important decisions, you are setting yourself up for a life of frustration and confusion. You&#8217;ll find yourself continually debating people and never winning except in your own mind. Few things are as destructive and limiting as a worldview that assumes people are mostly rational. </p>

				A continuous effort to make sense of things
			</a>
		</h3>
		
		<blockquote>
			<p>Unlike modern readers, who follow the flow of a narrative from beginning to end, early modern Englishmen read in fits and starts and jumped from book to book. They broke texts into fragments and assembled them into new patterns by transcribing them in different sections of their notebooks. Then they reread the copies and rearranged the patterns while adding more excerpts. Reading and writing were therefore inseparable activities. They belonged to a continuous effort to make sense of things, for the world was full of signs: you could read your way through it; and by keeping an account of your readings, you made a book of your own, one stamped with your personality. </p>
