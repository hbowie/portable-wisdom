		<h2>Quotations</h2>


		<hr />

		<h3>Occasions When the Intellect Retires Gracefully</h3>

		<p>topics: critical thinking</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>There are occasions when the intellect retires gracefully from a situation entirely behind its decorous control and leaves all the other complicated machinery of the mind to muddle through on its own. </p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>From
		the book
		<cite>
				Dancers In Mourning
			</cite>
		</p>

					<p>&mdash; 1934</p>


		<hr />

		<h3>The Only Sign of Mental Activity</h3>

		<p>topics: written word</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>The other pictures varied between the sentimentally lewd and the illustrated Scotch joke variety wherein Glengarried dogs take the place of figures. There were no books and a small writing table with drawers was the only sign of mental activity. </p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>From
		the book
		<cite>
				Dancers In Mourning
			</cite>
		</p>

					<p>&mdash; 1934</p>


		<hr />

		<h3>A Dark Procession</h3>

		<p>topics: critical thinking</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>Mercer did not think at all in the accepted sense of the word. Ideas occurred to him and engendered other ideas. But the process which linked any two of them was a dark procession taking place in some subconscious part of the brain. </p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>From
		the book
		<cite>
				Dancers in Mourning
			</cite>
		</p>

					<p>&mdash; 1934</p>


		<hr />

		<h3>Merely Thoroughly Outrageous</h3>

		<p>topics: cultural evolution</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>He made the discovery with a certain amount of relief, since it took him at least out of the region of pure fantasy and into the merely thoroughly outrageous, with which as a modern he was by now more or less familiar. </p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>From
		the book
		<cite>
				The Tiger in the Smoke
			</cite>
		</p>

					<p>&mdash; 1952</p>
