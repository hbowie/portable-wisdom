		<h2>Quotations</h2>


		<hr />

		<h3>All must be held valuable, or none</h3>

		<p>topics: equality, humanism</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>&#8220;But none of us has the right to assess the value of a human existence. All must be held valuable, or none. The death of Christ and the death of Socrates,&#8221; Fen added dryly, &#8220;suggest that our judgments are scarcely infallible&#8230; And the evil of Nazism lay precisely in this, that a group of men began to differentiate between the value of their fellow-beings, and to act on their conclusions. It isn&#8217;t a habit which I, for one, would like to encourage.&#8221; </p>

		<h3>The Divine Gift of Purely Nonsensical Speech and Action</h3>

		<p>topics: art, diversity</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>Fen sighed. &#8220;We are all becoming standardized and normal, Nigel. The divine gift of purely nonsensical speech and action is in atrophy. Would you believe it, a pupil of mine had the impertinence the other day to tick me off for reading him passages regarding the Fimble Fowl and the Quangle-Wangle as an illustration of pure poetic inventiveness; I put him in his place all right.&#8221; In the semi-darkness his eye became momentarily lambent with remembered satisfaction. &#8220;But there&#8217;s no eccentricity nowadays &#8211; none at all.&#8221; </p>

		<h3>An Irreplaceable Compact</h3>

		<p>topics: Murder, TecFiction, humanism</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>Euthanasia, Cadogan thought: they all regard it as that, and not as wilful slaughter, not as the violent cutting-off of an irreplaceable compact of passion and desire and affection and will; not as a thrust into unimagined and illimitable darkness. </p>
