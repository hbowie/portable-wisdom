		<h3>Generosity Among the Rich</h3>
		
		<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='../topics/connection.html' rel='tag'>connection</a></p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>Among the rich you will never find a really generous man even by accident. They may give their money away, but they will never give themselves away; they are egotistic, secretive, dry as old bones. To be smart enough to get all that money you must be dull enough to want it. </p>

		<h3>The difference between construction and creation</h3>
		
		<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='../topics/love.html' rel='tag'>love</a></p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>The whole difference between construction and creation is exactly this: that a thing constructed can only be loved after it is constructed; but a thing created is loved before it exists, as the mother can love the unborn child. </p>

		<h3>Conservatives and Progressives</h3>
		
		<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='../topics/governance.html' rel='tag'>governance</a><a class='tag-link' href='../topics/progress.html' rel='tag'>progress</a></p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>The whole modern world has divided itself into Conservatives and Progressives. The business of Progressives is to go on making mistakes. The business of Conservatives is to prevent mistakes from being corrected. Even when the revolutionist might himself repent of his revolution, the traditionalist is already defending it as part of his tradition. Thus we have two great types &#8211; the advanced person who rushes us into ruin, and the retrospective person who admires the ruins. He admires them especially by moonlight, not to say moonshine. Each new blunder of the progressive or prig becomes instantly a legend of immemorial antiquity for the snob. This is called the balance, or mutual check, in our Constitution. </p>

		<h3>This dazed and dramatic ignorance</h3>
		
		<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='../topics/wonder.html' rel='tag'>wonder</a></p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>One of the deepest and strangest of all human moods is the mood which will suddenly strike us perhaps in a garden at night, or deep in sloping meadows, the feeling that every flower and leaf has just uttered something stupendously direct and important, and that we have by a prodigy of imbecility not heard or understood it. There is a certain poetic value, and that a genuine one, in this sense of having missed the full meaning of things. There is beauty, not only in wisdom, but in this dazed and dramatic ignorance. </p>

		<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='../topics/love.html' rel='tag'>love</a><a class='tag-link' href='../topics/progress.html' rel='tag'>progress</a></p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>The cause which is blocking all progress today is the subtle scepticism which whispers in a million ears that things are not good enough to be worth improving. If the world is good we are revolutionaries, if the world is evil we must be conservatives. These essays, futile as they are considered as serious literature, are yet ethically sincere, since they seek to remind men that things must be loved first and improved afterwards. </p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, I don&#8217;t see the use of this; let us clear it away. To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: If you don&#8217;t see the use of it, I certainly won&#8217;t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it. </p>

		<h3>Mysticism has kept men sane</h3>
		
		<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='../topics/wonder.html' rel='tag'>wonder</a></p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>The truth is that Tolstoy, with his immense genius, with his colossal faith, with his vast fearlessness and vast knowledge of life, is deficient in one faculty and one faculty alone. He is not a mystic; and therefore he has a tendency to go mad. Men talk of the extravagances and frenzies that have been produced by mysticism; they are a mere drop in the bucket. In the main, and from the beginning of time, mysticism has kept men sane. The thing that has driven them mad was logic. &#8230;The only thing that has kept the race of men from the mad extremes of the convent and the pirate-galley, the night-club and the lethal chamber, has been mysticism&#8211; the belief that logic is misleading, and that things are not what they seem. </p>

		<h3>The center of every man's existence is a dream</h3>
		
		<p class="tags-align"><a class='tag-link' href='../topics/humanism.html' rel='tag'>humanism</a></p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>The center of every man&#8217;s existence is a dream. Death, disease, insanity, are merely material accidents, like a toothache or a twisted ankle. That these brutal forces always besiege and often capture the citadel does not prove that they are the citadel. </p>

		<h3>We are in Eden still</h3>

		<blockquote>
			<p>There runs a strange law through the length of human history &#8211; that men are continually tending to undervalue their environment, to undervalue their happiness, to undervalue themselves. The great sin of mankind, the sin typified by the fall of Adam, is the tendency, not towards pride, but towards this weird and horrible humility. </p>

<p>This is the great fall, the fall by which the fish forgets the sea, the ox forgets the meadow, the clerk forgets the city, every man forgets his environment and, in the fullest and most literal sense, forgets himself. This is the real fall of Adam, and it is a spiritual fall. It is a strange thing that many truly spiritual men, such as General Gordon, have actually spent some hours in speculating upon the precise location of the Garden of Eden. Most probably we are in Eden still. It is only our eyes that have changed. </p>
